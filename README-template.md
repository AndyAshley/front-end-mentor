## Overview

This is my 18th challenge from [Front-end-mentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). It was to code and style a stat tracker dashboard based on the design assets provided. (static **JPG** images).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
