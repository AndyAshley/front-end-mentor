## Overview

This is my 21st challenge from [Front-end-mentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). It was to code and style a multi-page space tourism website based on the design assets provided. (static **JPG** images).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [SwiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/)


### What I learned

Sometimes for projects like this its better to stick with vanilla CSS or SCSS. Bootstrap made things start to get hacky for me.

### Continued development

I want to add in some [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for the planets at some point.

### Useful resources

- [swiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/) - Swiper is the most modern free mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and amazing native behavior.
