## Overview

My first challenge with [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges). It was to code and style a QR card component based on the design assets provided.

## My process

I started with laying out the HTML stucture of the card, writing easily identifiable class names as I went. After I set up the structure, I created a style.css and added a :root for the color variables. I didnt have the **Pro** figma file so I based my styling off of the **JPG** images provided.
It was set up using flexbox so its pretty responsive already, though I did go in and add some media querys for smaller sizes to be safe.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to set up GitHub pages, and how to submit a solution on [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) !
