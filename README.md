## Overview

This is my 14th challenge from [Front-end-mentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). It was to code and style a rating card component based on the design assets provided. (static **JPG** images)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned more about CSS transform rotate with preserve 3d and perspective. I wanted to do something more from a **UI/UX** perspective when a user submitted a rating.

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools flip card](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp) - This helped me figure out the transition that I wanted to make on a successful submit.
