## Overview

This is my 21st challenge from [Front-end-mentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). It was to code and style a multi-page space tourism website based on the design assets provided. (static **JPG** images).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [SwiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/)

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Sometimes for projects like this its better to stick with vanilla CSS or SCSS. Bootstrap made things start to get hacky for me.

### Continued development

I want to add in some [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for the planets at some point.

### Useful resources

- [swiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/) - Swiper is the most modern free mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and amazing native behavior.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
