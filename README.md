## Overview

This is my 13th challenge from [Front-end-mentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). It was to code and style a single price card component based on the design assets provided. (static **JPG** images)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action
